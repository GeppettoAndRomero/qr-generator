# Security Policy

`qr-generator` runs entirely in your browser. There is no server component and no
account system, so the text you type is never uploaded and there is no redirect or
tracking layer between the QR code and its content. Most classic web
vulnerabilities (server-side injection, auth bypass, data exfiltration via a
backend) do not apply.

We still take client-side security seriously — XSS, supply-chain issues in
dependencies, a service worker caching bug, or anything that could cause your text
to leave your device (including via a shared/URL-encoded state — none of the input
is ever put in the URL).

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately, not in a public issue:

- Email: **security@runlocally.app**
- Or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting (Security → Report a vulnerability).

Include what you found, steps to reproduce, and the impact you expect. We aim to
acknowledge within a few days. Please give us a reasonable window to ship a fix
before public disclosure.

## Scope

In scope:

- This repository's source and the deployed site.
- The QR encoding path, the service worker, and the PWA manifest.
- Anything that could send typed text off the device.

Out of scope:

- Findings that require a compromised device or a malicious browser extension.
- Missing hardening headers that have no concrete exploit.

Thank you for helping keep users safe.
